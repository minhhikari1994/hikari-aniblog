Hello everyone. As of now, it's been one month into the Spring 2024 Anime Season. Ideally, I had planned to kick off the new Anime season with a post earlier. However, at that time, the blog wasn't stable enough to allow for relaxed writing.

"Today, everything is much more stable. So, I'm taking advantage of this last day of a 5-day holiday to finish up this post. And since it's already the beginning of May, this post can't really be a 'kick-off' for a new anime season anymore. Therefore, let this post reflect on what the first month of Spring 2024 has brought to me (even though the structure of this post won't be much different from previous kick-off posts).

# TV series I'm following this season

The title says it all, here is the complete list of anime series I'm currently following this season.

name: "Kami wa Game ni Ueteiru."

studios: LIDENFILMS
genres: Fantasy, Suspense, Ecchi, High Stakes Game, Strategy Game

Set in a fantasy world where humans constantly challenge themselves to win in games set by the Gods. The story of the anime revolves around Fay Theo Philus and the former god Leoleshea as they strive to win the games of the gods to fulfill their own wishes. For Leoleshea, it's to return to godhood, while for Fay, it's the desire to reunite with the elder sister who instilled in him the passion and enjoyment of games.

So far, this anime has been quite entertaining for me. The introduction of the first two games has sparked curiosity as now the participants have no clear objectives, but must discover the rules of the game and how to win on their own.

This is the second cour for the second season of **Mushoku Tensei** series, a fairly popular anime in recent years. The first season of the anime aired in Winter 2021 (Cour 1) and Fall 2021 (Cour 2). The first cour of Season 2 also aired in the past Summer 2023.

studios: Gekkou
genres: Comedy, Romance, Supernatural

::

A heartwarming story about Mr. and Mrs. Saitou, who somehow magically find themselves back in their youth. This series isn't particularly outstanding, but it's quite enjoyable and cute.

name: "Tsuki ga Michibiku Isekai Douchuu 2nd Season - 2nd Cour"

studios: J.C.Staff
genres: Action, Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy, Isekai

The second season of **Tsuki ga Michibiku Isekai Douchuu** will continue with its second cour this season. The anime premiered its first season in the Summer of 2021.

genres: Adventure, Fantasy, Romance, Isekai

The story of the anime revolves around a merchant named Banaza, who doesn't care about racial differences and is inadvertently summoned to another world. However, he's just an ordinary merchant, unable to use magic, lacking combat abilities, and possessing extremely low stats. Bullied and unrecognized for his role as a hero, he is pushed to the northern forest of the kingdom, only to wait for death. However, behind his limited level of Lv2, Banaza harbors a power that could be considered "cheating" in the world.

This is the story of Banaza, seeking the peaceful and tranquil life of a former Level 2 hero.

name: "Unnamed Memory"
image: https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1143/142439l.jpg
studios: ENGI
genres: Adventure, Fantasy, Romance
---
::

Cursed since childhood with an unbreakable curse, Oscar, the prince of the Faras kingdom, seeks out the witch Tinasha to break the curse. However, upon seeing her, Oscar comes up with a bolder idea and asks Tinasha to become his wife. The witch doesn't entirely support the idea, but agrees to live in the kingdom with Oscar as his protector. And thus begins their intertwined destinies, where the connections and twists of fate between these two individuals become entwined, along with secrets larger than what meets the eye.

It can be said that ENGI is doing quite well with **Unnamed Memory**, as I myself find the story quite captivating. Hopefully, they can maintain this momentum until the end.

name: "Hananoi-kun to Koi no Yamai"
image: https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1646/141411l.jpg
studios: East Fish Studio
genres: Romance, School
---
::

The story revolves around the duo Hananoi - a smart guy with a rather peculiar personality - and Hitose Hotaru - a somewhat clueless girl who doesn't quite understand what love is. This anime is definitely going to be a sweet high school romance, but for me, it's not particularly enjoyable if you're not accustomed to this genre.

name: "Maou no Ore ga Dorei Elf wo Yome ni Shitanda ga, Dou Medereba Ii?"
image: https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1346/141203l.jpg
studios: Brain's Base
genres: Action, Fantasy, Romance

After just one glance at Nephelia during an auction, the wizard Zagan went all out, spending nearly all his assets to buy this Elf lady. The only problem is that this Zagan guy - someone who has devoted his entire life to studying magic - has absolutely no knowledge or common sense when it comes to love. So, he himself doesn't know how to deal with his "love at first sight" for Nephelia.

In a world where wizards like Zagan are considered criminals, I have to say that the story of **Maou no Ore ga Dorei Elf wo Yome ni Shitanda ga, Dou Medereba Ii?** can surprisingly be fun and humorous because of Zagan's eccentricity and Nephelia's seemingly intentional boldness. And I truly hope that the story of this anime will continue to keep me intrigued in the remaining two months.

name: "Highspeed Etoile"

studios: Studio A-CAT
genres: Racing

::

The story of this pure racing anime takes viewers to the NEX Race (which can be understood as the F1 of the future) through the eyes of Rindou Rin, a racer for an unknown team, a girl who gave up her dream of becoming a ballet dancer due to an unworthy injury.

name: "Maou Gakuin no Futekigousha II: Shijou Saikyou no Maou no Shiso, Tensei shite Shison-tachi no Gakkou e Kayou Part 2"
image: https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1399/141651l.jpg
studios: SILVER LINK.
genres: Action, Fantasy, Mythology, Reincarnation, School
---
::

Audiences will continue to accompany the badass Demon Lord Anos Voldigoad with the second cour of season 2 of **Maou Gakuin no Futekigousha** this season.

Honestly, I find the plot of **Maou Gakuin no Futekigousha** extremely messy and sometimes hard to follow, but I still enjoy watching it. I guess it's because the series has that "cool" factor that appeals to me.

name: "One Room, Hiatari Futsuu, Tenshi-tsuki."
image: https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1833/141321l.jpg
studios: Okuruto Noboru
genres: Comedy, Romance, Supernatural, Harem, Mythology

Shintarou Tokumitsu is a fairly ordinary high school student who currently lives alone. One day, his life is turned upside down when he encounters an angel (literally an angel) named Towa, sent from heaven to learn about and befriend humans. From then on, Shintaro's life takes a completely new turn as he gets involved with supernatural phenomena.

After the highly questionable **Sokushi Cheat ga Saikyou sugite, Isekai no Yatsura ga Marude Aite ni Naranai n desu ga.** from the previous season, **One Room, Hiatari Futsuu, Tenshi-tsuki.** by **Okuruto Noboru** must be said to be much more worth watching with a decent plot and characters. Although it still doesn't stand out too much compared to other rom-com works out there.

studios: 8bit
genres: Action, Fantasy, Romance, Sci-Fi, School

The third season of **The Irregular at Magic High School** will return to the audience this season. And of course, I'll continue to follow it because I've been following this anime since then until now.

name: "The New Gate"

studios: Yokohama Animation Lab x Cloud Hearts
genres: Action, Adventure, Fantasy, Isekai

The setting of this anime is no different from SAO: it's also a death game, and the main character named Kiritani Shinya is no different from Kirito. He's the one who successfully defeated the final boss and helped other players escape from the virtual world they were trapped in. However, he's different. Instead of logging out, he's isekai'd into the world of this game 500 years later (of course, with all the badassery he had before). And this is the beginning of a completely new story in his life.

The plot is quite ordinary, but what I'm looking forward to is the reunion between Shinya and Schnee in the future. I have to admit, this title isn't too bad, but it's also not one of the standout names this season.

# Most anticipated TV Series

And finally, among the countless titles of Spring 2024, these are currently the two names that excite me the most. And it's quite certain that at least one of these two will become my Personal Anime of The Season.

::tv-entry
---
name: "Ookami to Koushinryou: Merchant Meets the Wise Wolf"
image: https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1059/142414l.jpg
studios: Passione
genres: Adventure, Drama, Fantasy, Romance, Adult Cast
---
::

At first, I didn't really pay much attention to this title, and honestly, I wasn't too intrigued by it. So, I was somewhat curious and wondered why **Spice and Wolf** garnered so much attention when the anime first aired in 2008. However, after the first 5 episodes of the remake that Passione brought to the audience this season, I may have somewhat understood why this remake of **"Spice and Wolf** is such a noteworthy and audience-friendly title.

The story between the merchant Lawrence and the wise wolf Holo is one of the titles I'm extremely looking forward to watching every Tuesday night. Much of it comes from the fact that this anime has a rather chill atmosphere. Passione has invested quite seriously and meticulously in this title, from the music to the graphics and animation. I really enjoy the dynamic interaction and relationship between Holo and Lawrence, which is the highlight and center of the entire story. It's just adorable and captivating.

The first 5 episodes left me extremely satisfied with the quality, and it's probably why I could see and understand why **Spice and Wolf** was considered a classic LN and anime when it was first released. Hopefully, **Passione** will be able to maintain what they have achieved. Especially since this anime will run for 2 consecutive seasons with a total of 25 episodes.

name: "Hibike! Euphonium 3"
image: https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1216/142086l.jpg
studios: Kyoto Animation
genres: Drama, Music, Performing Arts, School

I've been eagerly anticipating continuing the journey of Kumiko Oumae and the Kitauji High School concert band after having precious experiences with the previous two seasons. After a long wait, my favorite studio - **Kyoto Animation** - has officially returned with the third season of **Sound! Euphonium** - one of the most important anime series for me.

I'm always amazed by how **Kyoto Animation** carefully crafts their works to be memorable and impactful for the viewers. With **Hibike! Euphonium**, they beautifully captured the essence of "youth". That's why I was deeply moved after the first two seasons (especially with the unforgettable second season). Looking at Kumiko's journey throughout the series, you might see a resemblance to yourself. And it's this character development that makes **Hibike! Euphonium** so influential to me.

At least for now, I'm completely mesmerized by what **Kyoto Animation** has achieved with this 3rd season. And because we're talking about a studio with a very high production line quality in the anime industry, I firmly believe that what **Kyoto Animation** has and will bring to **Sound! Euphonium** will be a beautiful conclusion to the story of youth and the aspiration to become better and progress every day, not just for Kumiko but for the spirit of those inspired by this anime, like myself.

# The end


And that wraps up my Spring 2024! A little sneak peek: if everything goes smoothly, I'll be returning to Copenhagen in June. Hopefully, everything will go smoothly. And of course, no matter where I am or what I do, anime will continue to be an essential part of my life in the future.
